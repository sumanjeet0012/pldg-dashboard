During the session, I asked a series of questions that were pivotal to understanding the integration of EVM support into Filecoin, which aligns closely with my focus areas. You can find the full list of questions at https://docs.google.com/document/d/119cYju5YDNqNLJPXS2_JyzcAROM30YcvBDodnJ-s9rE/edit?tab=t.0 . 

Key Topics I Explored:

- Integration of EVM into Filecoin: I sought to understand the technical details of how EVM smart contracts are being integrated, whether through a particular layer (e.g., L2 or sidechain) or directly into the protocol.
  
- Cross-Chain Interoperability: I inquired about Filecoin’s collaborations with Solana and Ethereum via CCIP, as it has significant implications for decentralized applications and developers working across chains.

- Developer Tooling: I asked about compatibility with existing Ethereum tools like Truffle and Hardhat and whether developers would need to adapt their toolchains to Filecoin’s environment.


Why This Session Stood Out:

The session provided valuable insights that are directly applicable to the projects I am working on “on ramp contracts” and “FEVM op-codes” (please visit https://feather-address-beb.notion.site/FIL-B-PLDG-11998ea557918017abc6c0f13e2be838 and https://github.com/ZenGround0/onramp-contracts/issues ). These insights will guide us as we implement smart contract functionality that ties together decentralized storage and computation, further empowering the decentralized web and Web3 ecosystems.

I later had a follow-up call with Molly where we discussed utilizing the strengths of EVM compatibility in Filecoin for the development of 2 utility ERC-20 tokens on Filecoin, which I have been trying to deploy to Filecoin Calibration testnet.  Please visit https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R2IU_3avnRvXXp8UQmMEuwTH0w4fMfybLqpcAZUOLqk/edit?tab=t.0
",Yes,"Fil-B,Fil-Oz,IPFS,Storacha","I’ve been actively engaging with the Filecoin Builders team, focusing on learning and contributing to projects such as the OnRamp Contract (currently improving the documentation of the GitHub repo: https://github.com/seetadev/onramp-contracts , shared during a recent call with Sarah), exploring FEVM OpCodes, and working on integrating EtherCalc into the Buidl Guidl website.

Molly and ZenGround have been a great help in guiding me, especially since the initial efforts on these projects were developed by the Fil-OZ team. 

I’ve also prepared a list of questions addressing builder adoption for the effort “EVM compatibility architecture”: please visit https://docs.google.com/document/d/119cYju5YDNqNLJPXS2_JyzcAROM30YcvBDodnJ-s9rE/edit?tab=t.0 and page 2 at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R2IU_3avnRvXXp8UQmMEuwTH0w4fMfybLqpcAZUOLqk/edit?tab=t.0 
I did discuss with Molly at AMA call. Further, had a follow-up call for the questions I was unable to discuss during AMA call.
I’m set to follow up on these questions with Sarah and will create a pull request at github after discussing it on Monday. Sarah has been a consistent point of contact, especially when working on EVM compatibility and on-ramp contracts. She and Molly have helped tremendously in bootstrapping the tickets related to these projects, providing critical guidance and support as we refine the development process. I will be meeting Longfei and Mike in the coming week’s call.

Wish to also share some of the earlier efforts I undertook in first week and first 3 days of second week before the assigning of the tech-partners:

IPFS Helia Team:

I attended IPFS working group meeting and was an active participant in 2 of the tickets discussed (please visit https://foregoing-plantain-cf9.notion.site/2024-10-03-Helia-Working-Group-10e1def34287818b8ba5c6f453269c90#10e1def342878178a00fe9ebb4ce70d6  )

Our discussions revolved around the IPFS Helia CLI and IPFS Web UI, exploring how to enhance and integrate its functionalities to better serve decentralized applications. We’ve been tackling key areas like performance improvements and ensuring seamless compatibility with other tools.

Storacha Team:
While my interactions with the Storacha team are still evolving for the 2nd ticket assigned by Sarah from Filecoin Builders Group, we’ve discussed areas of collaboration around decentralized storage and how Storacha’s work aligns with the larger Filecoin and IPFS ecosystems; developing a telegram mini app with Storacha as the storage layer.

Across all these teams, the collaborative environment and shared expertise have been invaluable, helping me contribute more effectively to Protocol Labs' decentralized technology stack. Wish to also thank Katie and Anubha for their wonderful support and encouragement. Katie shared key resources and links on FIPs, which enabled us to bootstrap quickly and productively.

",,10,"I’ve had a great experience engaging with the PLDG stewards and the guild’s programming so far. Wish to share a few suggestions that could enhance the experience even further:

Cross-Team Collaboration: Encouraging more opportunities for collaboration between different teams like Filecoin Builders, Filecoin Oz, and other guilds. This could facilitate deeper integrations and bring fresh perspectives to ongoing projects.

Workshops on Niche Topics: Hosting more focused workshops or AMA sessions on niche topics like FEVM OpCodes, on-ramp contracts, or storage-computation synergies in decentralized applications. These could dive deeper into the technical complexities and engage more developers in specialized areas.

The js-ipfs-fetch library, built with Kubo, plays a crucial role in the IPFS ecosystem by providing a fetch-like API for retrieving content via IPFS, making decentralized file access feel as seamless as traditional web requests. Its impact is significant because it simplifies integrating IPFS into web applications, allowing developers to use familiar HTTP-like requests while accessing content from the distributed IPFS network. It’s particularly cool because it's used in projects like the Agregore browser, which aims to decentralize the web experience by using protocols like IPFS.

Impact of my contribution:
This bug affects files with spaces or special characters in their filenames, which are URL-encoded. It makes it impossible to retrieve or serve such files via IPFS, limiting support for a wide range of common file names, particularly screenshots and user-generated content. The issue impacts the reliability of the IPFS protocol handler for many practical use cases, reducing accessibility to files with more complex filenames.

",Yes,3,Update Readme with correct implementation instructions for calibrationnet,https://github.com/FIL-Builders/onramp-contracts/issues/1,"The issue at hand, outlined in FIL-Builders OnRamp Contracts Issue #1(https://github.com/FIL-Builders/onramp-contracts/issues/1), revolves around enhancing the accessibility and comprehension of the project for developers aiming to integrate Filecoin’s capabilities with EVM-compatible environments.

In my conversation with LongfeiW, we discussed the ongoing work around the OnRamp Contracts project, which includes reviewing and improving both the documentation and the overall structure of the smart contracts repository. Longfei shared the repository link and original FilOz documentation, providing valuable context to help me get started. This groundwork has been essential in identifying key areas for improvement and how best to contribute.


Key Points of the Issue:
1. Documentation Gaps: Currently, the documentation is not as clear as it could be, making it challenging for new contributors to understand the OnRamp contract’s functionality and deployment processes. A more comprehensive README and detailed guides on setup, usage, and contribution are necessary.

2. Code Structure: The repository could benefit from increased modularity and better documentation within the code itself. There are areas for refactoring functions and improving overall readability to accommodate developers less familiar with the project.

3. Usage of EVM OpCodes: With the focus on EVM compatibility, it’s essential to ensure that EVM opcodes and contract logic follow best practices for both Filecoin and Ethereum. The issue highlights potential optimizations in how Filecoin’s storage capabilities and Ethereum’s smart contracts interact.

4. Testing and Deployment: There is a need for more robust testing to ensure the contracts perform well under different conditions. This includes optimizing gas costs and efficiently utilizing storage and computation resources.

Planned Contributions:
- Improving Documentation: I’ll focus on expanding the repository’s documentation with detailed guides, code comments, and examples to make it easier for new developers to engage.
- Refactoring: I'll also review the codebase to suggest structural improvements and help with modularizing key components, particularly those related to EVM.
- Addressing OpCodes: I plan to analyze the usage of EVM opcodes to ensure they are implemented according to best practices and optimized for interaction with Filecoin.
",Update Readme with correct implementation instructions for calibrationnet + IPC,https://github.com/FIL-Builders/onramp-contracts/issues/2,"The issue outlined in [FIL-Builders OnRamp Contracts Issue #2(https://github.com/FIL-Builders/onramp-contracts/issues/2) focuses on the integration and optimization of cross-chain messaging for the OnRamp Contracts. This is a key aspect of the OnRamp project, as it enables seamless interaction between Filecoin’s storage capabilities and other EVM-compatible chains, such as Ethereum.

Key Points of the Issue:
1. Cross-Chain Messaging Support: The primary objective of this issue is to evaluate and implement a robust cross-chain messaging solution that facilitates communication between the Filecoin network and other blockchains. This will enable users to bridge assets and data between ecosystems efficiently. Several potential protocols and tools, such as CCIP (Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol) or existing messaging frameworks, can be explored for this purpose.

2. Optimizing Gas and Resource Usage: Cross-chain operations can often incur high gas fees and require careful resource management. Part of the issue is to evaluate how these costs can be minimized, ensuring that the OnRamp Contracts maintain efficiency without compromising security or functionality.

3. Security Considerations: Another critical aspect is ensuring that cross-chain messaging and asset transfers are secure. This involves reviewing potential attack vectors, such as replay attacks or contract vulnerabilities, and implementing necessary safeguards to protect users.

4. Interoperability Testing: Testing the integration with various EVM-compatible chains will be crucial to ensure the cross-chain messaging solution is reliable and works seamlessly across multiple environments. The issue calls for creating test scenarios that simulate real-world cross-chain interactions.

Planned Contributions:
- Researching Cross-Chain Solutions: I will start by researching various cross-chain messaging protocols and tools to determine the best fit for the OnRamp Contracts. This may involve reviewing existing projects like Chainlink’s CCIP or exploring other messaging frameworks.
  
- Developing and Testing Cross-Chain Messaging: Once a suitable solution is identified, I will focus on integrating it into the OnRamp Contracts, ensuring it aligns with the existing architecture. Extensive testing will be conducted to validate that cross-chain transfers work as intended.

- Optimizing Gas Costs: I’ll work on identifying areas where gas usage can be optimized for cross-chain transactions, ensuring that the contracts are efficient and scalable.

- Security Enhancements: I will also contribute by reviewing the security aspects of cross-chain messaging and proposing enhancements to safeguard the system from potential threats.
",Identifying use-cases and applications for @libp2p/example-webrtc-private-to-private,https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-example-webrtc-private-to-private,"The project I'm working on focuses on identifying use cases and applications for the @libp2p/js-libp2p-example-webrtc-private-to-private (https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-example-webrtc-private-to-private), which explores how WebRTC can facilitate private-to-private connections using the libp2p networking stack. This use case aims to leverage libp2p’s peer-to-peer capabilities to create a decentralized communication system that can operate securely between private peers without relying on a centralized server.

 Key Points of the Project:
1. Private-to-Private WebRTC Connectivity: The primary goal is to establish direct, secure connections between private peers using WebRTC protocols. This approach has wide-ranging applications for peer-to-peer communications, file transfers, and decentralized apps (dApps), ensuring that users can communicate or exchange data without compromising privacy or relying on central intermediaries.

2. Libp2p Networking Stack: The project is built on libp2p, which provides a flexible networking stack for peer-to-peer communications. The WebRTC example demonstrates how libp2p can be applied to real-world use cases, such as enabling decentralized collaboration tools or messaging platforms that prioritize user privacy.

3. Identifying Practical Use Cases: A major part of my contribution involves identifying the most promising applications for this WebRTC example. These could include decentralized file sharing, secure communication networks, peer-to-peer collaboration tools, or even privacy-focused IoT applications. The challenge is to explore how the underlying technology can serve diverse industries while maintaining security and efficiency.

 DevGrant from Filecoin:
In 2023, I received a devgrant from Filecoin (https://github.com/ipfs/devgrants/issues/263) where I tried using libp2p with IPFS. Wish to share that I will dedicate some time exploring how Filecoin’s decentralized storage solutions can be integrated with libp2p’s networking capabilities, especially in the context of peer-to-peer communications.

The project also ties into the broader goal of making decentralized networks more accessible and practical for developers, which is why this example is crucial in demonstrating how libp2p can solve real-world networking challenges while promoting privacy and decentralization.

 Planned Contributions:
- Exploring Use Cases: I’m actively working on identifying and documenting use cases for this technology, ranging from secure messaging and decentralized collaboration platforms to privacy-focused IoT networks.
- Further Development and Refinement: As part of this ongoing effort, I’ll be refining the codebase and exploring additional features to improve the ease of use and adoption of libp2p-based WebRTC applications.
- Integration with Filecoin: Another key aspect is investigating how Filecoin’s decentralized storage solutions can complement this private-to-private connection framework, particularly in use cases that require secure, verifiable storage.

",Yes,4+,Update Readme with correct implementation instructions for calibrationnet ,https://github.com/FIL-Builders/onramp-contracts/issues/1,"The issue at hand, outlined in FIL-Builders OnRamp Contracts Issue #1(https://github.com/FIL-Builders/onramp-contracts/issues/1), revolves around enhancing the accessibility and comprehension of the project for developers aiming to integrate Filecoin’s capabilities with EVM-compatible environments. 

Project Tasks and Progress this week: 
Project tasks were to implement the deployment steps, verify contract functionality, and troubleshoot any errors that arose during the process.

To achieve this, I collaborated with Abhishek and FIL Builders team, who provided helpful guidance and troubleshooting resources. ZenGround’s gist(https://gist.github.com/ZenGround0/c1b2ce669522f6aac85ef6d9130b5fe0) was especially useful, detailing steps to resolve deployment errors, and referencing related issues within the onramp contracts repository(https://github.com/FIL-Builders/onramp-contracts/issues) for further insights.

During deployment, I initially encountered errors, but with Abhishek’s support, I resolved these issues and achieved a successful deployment. I documented this outcome with a screenshot(https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1s_TSbHx5X7jYJxBvaROkUy9yyuVdwAsx) of the deployed contract as proof of completion.

Planned Contributions:
- Improving Documentation: I’ll focus on expanding the repository’s documentation with detailed guides, code comments, and examples to make it easier for new developers to engage.
- Refactoring: I'll also review the codebase to suggest structural improvements and help with modularizing key components, particularly those related to EVM.
- Addressing OpCodes: I plan to analyze the usage of EVM opcodes to ensure they are implemented according to best practices and optimized for interaction with Filecoin.

This project plays a critical role in bridging Filecoin's storage network with Ethereum’s decentralized finance and smart contract ecosystems. By making the OnRamp contracts more accessible and optimized, we can streamline integrations and support wider adoption of Filecoin as a storage layer for EVM-compatible chains.
",Update Readme with correct implementation instructions for calibrationnet + IPC,https://github.com/FIL-Builders/onramp-contracts/issues/2,"The issue outlined in [FIL-Builders OnRamp Contracts Issue #2(https://github.com/FIL-Builders/onramp-contracts/issues/2) focuses on the integration and optimization of cross-chain messaging for the OnRamp Contracts. This is a key aspect of the OnRamp project, as it enables seamless interaction between Filecoin’s storage capabilities and other EVM-compatible chains, such as Ethereum.

Key Points of the Issue:
1. Cross-Chain Messaging Support: The primary objective of this issue is to evaluate and implement a robust cross-chain messaging solution that facilitates communication between the Filecoin network and other blockchains. This will enable users to bridge assets and data between ecosystems efficiently. Several potential protocols and tools, such as CCIP (Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol) or existing messaging frameworks, can be explored for this purpose.

2. Optimizing Gas and Resource Usage: Cross-chain operations can often incur high gas fees and require careful resource management. Part of the issue is to evaluate how these costs can be minimized, ensuring that the OnRamp Contracts maintain efficiency without compromising security or functionality.

3. Security Considerations: Another critical aspect is ensuring that cross-chain messaging and asset transfers are secure. This involves reviewing potential attack vectors, such as replay attacks or contract vulnerabilities, and implementing necessary safeguards to protect users.

4. Interoperability Testing: Testing the integration with various EVM-compatible chains will be crucial to ensure the cross-chain messaging solution is reliable and works seamlessly across multiple environments. The issue calls for creating test scenarios that simulate real-world cross-chain interactions.

Planned Contributions:
- Researching Cross-Chain Solutions: I will start by researching various cross-chain messaging protocols and tools to determine the best fit for the OnRamp Contracts. This may involve reviewing existing projects like Chainlink’s CCIP or exploring other messaging frameworks.
  
- Developing and Testing Cross-Chain Messaging: Once a suitable solution is identified, I will focus on integrating it into the OnRamp Contracts, ensuring it aligns with the existing architecture. Extensive testing will be conducted to validate that cross-chain transfers work as intended.

- Optimizing Gas Costs: I’ll work on identifying areas where gas usage can be optimized for cross-chain transactions, ensuring that the contracts are efficient and scalable.

- Security Enhancements: I will also contribute by reviewing the security aspects of cross-chain messaging and proposing enhancements to safeguard the system from potential threats.
",Add QUIC transport support,https://github.com/libp2p/py-libp2p/issues/463,"The ticket #463(https://github.com/libp2p/py-libp2p/issues/463) aims to add QUIC transport support to the Python implementation of libp2p. QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) is a modern transport protocol that combines the speed of UDP with built-in features typically provided at higher layers, like security and reliability. The inclusion of QUIC is essential for libp2p to improve low-latency communication, resilience to network changes, and support for connection multiplexing, which is critical for high-performance decentralized networks.

Wish to share that I have started the groundwork on adding QUIC transport support to py-libp2p, as outlined in [project ticket #463(https://github.com/libp2p/py-libp2p/issues/463). This ticket involves implementing QUIC, a transport layer protocol known for its efficiency and reliability, into the Python implementation of libp2p. Adding QUIC support is essential for enhancing the network’s performance, particularly for applications that require low-latency, secure, and resilient connections.

I received this assignment from Dave after demonstrating engagement and making contributions across the libp2p ecosystem. Dave was incredibly helpful, taking the time to walk me through the requirements and technical challenges of the ticket. His guidance has been instrumental in outlining the steps needed to integrate QUIC and align it with the existing py-libp2p architecture.

According to the libp2p QUIC documentation(https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/transports/quic/), QUIC provides benefits such as connection multiplexing, security via TLS 1.3, and reduced latency. In the context of libp2p, adding QUIC transport allows more efficient data transmission, improving the network’s ability to handle dynamic network conditions while ensuring secure connections. QUIC's features align well with libp2p's goals for modularity and decentralized connectivity, as it can adapt to network disruptions more effectively than traditional TCP.
","I'm also working on identifying use cases and applications for the @libp2p/js-libp2p-example-webrtc-private-to-private (https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-example-webrtc-private-to-private), which explores how WebRTC can facilitate private-to-private connections using the libp2p networking stack. This project was discussed in detail at go-libp2p maintainer's call. 

 This use case aims to leverage libp2p’s peer-to-peer capabilities to create a decentralized communication system that can operate securely between private peers without relying on a centralized server.

 Key Points of the Project:
1. Private-to-Private WebRTC Connectivity: The primary goal is to establish direct, secure connections between private peers using WebRTC protocols. This approach has wide-ranging applications for peer-to-peer communications, file transfers, and decentralized apps (dApps), ensuring that users can communicate or exchange data without compromising privacy or relying on central intermediaries.

2. Libp2p Networking Stack: The project is built on libp2p, which provides a flexible networking stack for peer-to-peer communications. The WebRTC example demonstrates how libp2p can be applied to real-world use cases, such as enabling decentralized collaboration tools or messaging platforms that prioritize user privacy.

3. Identifying Practical Use Cases: A major part of my contribution involves identifying the most promising applications for this WebRTC example. These could include decentralized file sharing, secure communication networks, peer-to-peer collaboration tools, or even privacy-focused IoT applications. The challenge is to explore how the underlying technology can serve diverse industries while maintaining security and efficiency.

 DevGrant from Filecoin:
In 2023, I received a devgrant from Filecoin (https://github.com/ipfs/devgrants/issues/263) where I tried using libp2p with IPFS. Wish to share that I will dedicate some time exploring how Filecoin’s decentralized storage solutions can be integrated with libp2p’s networking capabilities, especially in the context of peer-to-peer communications.

The project also ties into the broader goal of making decentralized networks more accessible and practical for developers, which is why this example is crucial in demonstrating how libp2p can solve real-world networking challenges while promoting privacy and decentralization.

 Planned Contributions:
- Exploring Use Cases: I’m actively working on identifying and documenting use cases for this technology, ranging from secure messaging and decentralized collaboration platforms to privacy-focused IoT networks.
- Further Development and Refinement: As part of this ongoing effort, I’ll be refining the codebase and exploring additional features to improve the ease of use and adoption of libp2p-based WebRTC applications.
- Integration with Filecoin: Another key aspect is investigating how Filecoin’s decentralized storage solutions can complement this private-to-private connection framework, particularly in use cases that require secure, verifiable storage.

This project is part of a larger effort to explore decentralized communication tools, and I’m excited about the possibilities that WebRTC and libp2p can unlock for the future of private, peer-to-peer connectivity.
",10,"The libp2p maintainers' calls for the Rust, Python, and JavaScript modules were incredibly insightful and well-coordinated, offering a valuable platform to connect with fellow developers and gain a deeper understanding of each module’s architecture and ongoing priorities. Here are some feedback and suggestions for the PLDG stewards and guild organizers based on these sessions:

1. Cross-Module Collaboration: The cross-pollination of ideas between maintainers of different language implementations (Rust, Python, JavaScript) was a highlight. Introducing more cross-module discussion time could facilitate even deeper collaboration, allowing maintainers to share challenges, best practices, and architectural strategies across language boundaries.

2. Focused Sessions on Key Features: It would be beneficial to hold specialized sessions focusing on implementing crucial features like QUIC support or WebRTC capabilities across all libp2p implementations. These focused discussions could lead to more consistency and shared resources across the various language implementations.

3. Increased Support for Non-Core Modules: Expanding support for non-core language implementations like `py-libp2p` would encourage growth and parity across implementations. This could include assigning specific stewards or maintaining a stronger mentor program for teams working on smaller, but important, modules.

This meeting not only provided an opportunity for deep technical discussion but also connected me with Adin Schmahmann, Director at IP Shipyard. Adin’s work is pivotal in building a more resilient web through IPFS and libp2p, and his guidance during our 1.5-hour meeting was invaluable.

Our conversation focused on the IPFS service-worker gateway project (https://github.com/ipfs/service-worker-gateway), a project aimed at enhancing browser-based IPFS interactions. This gateway, utilizing service workers, aims to make decentralized data retrieval more efficient and user-friendly by allowing browsers to access IPFS content directly without relying on external gateways. Adin walked me through the technical underpinnings of the gateway, shedding light on key architectural choices and optimizations to make in-browser content retrieval smoother and more resilient. 

Additionally, with Adin’s help, I had the chance to test inbrowser.link—a browser-compatible IPFS link format designed to demonstrate the accessibility of IPFS content within browser environments. Testing with the example link he provided (https://bafkreiaofbtkcyv2pws4zzaneiptp2ftjzwwp2e6qqpglhhglm5q3l467i.ipfs.inbrowser.dev/) allowed me to see firsthand the potential of direct IPFS access in a browser setting, which is essential for scaling decentralized web use cases.

This session was particularly informative because it combined a practical demonstration with a deep dive into how IPFS can evolve to meet modern web demands. With direct access to IPFS content, web apps can achieve unprecedented levels of resilience and decentralization, and this experience has broadened my understanding of the possible integrations and optimizations within the IPFS ecosystem.

",Yes,"Fil-B,IPFS,Libp2p","Libp2p

My recent work with libp2p has involved a productive collaboration with Adin Schmahmann, Director at IP Shipyard. As a pivotal figure in advancing a more resilient web using IPFS and libp2p, Adin’s expertise has been incredibly beneficial for my projects. We engaged in an in-depth, 1.5-hour discussion during the go-libp2p maintainer’s call on October 31st, covering a range of topics central to improving decentralised web protocols.

Our primary focus was the IPFS service-worker gateway project(https://github.com/ipfs/service-worker-gateway), a project that Adin is heavily involved in. The discussion allowed me to gain a better understanding of how service workers can be used to facilitate direct access to IPFS content in browsers, eliminating the need for external gateways and significantly enhancing the potential for resilient web applications. Adin explained the architectural considerations and trade-offs, providing insights on optimising the gateway for performance and reliability.

He also helped me in scoping the ticket issue assigned to me (libp2p/py-libp2p#463(https://github.com/libp2p/py-libp2p/issues/463)). With his guidance, I refined the action plan and detailed items for the ticket, which I also documented in the Statement of Work(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p8-KuDrntDqEnuZQpohhN9huxt79P8Oipx-jlL9OqPI/edit?tab=t.0). Additionally, Adin assisted in identifying key use cases for another project, the js-libp2p example for WebRTC private-to-private connections(https://github.com/seetadev/js-libp2p-example-webrtc-private-to-private), which has been instrumental in advancing my work on decentralised peer-to-peer connectivity.

Moreover, Adin helped me test a new IPFS functionality, inbrowser.link. This format aims to make IPFS content more accessible in browser environments, pushing the boundaries of decentralized web capabilities. With his guidance, I experimented with a specific link (https://bafkreiaofbtkcyv2pws4zzaneiptp2ftjzwwp2e6qqpglhhglm5q3l467i.ipfs.inbrowser.dev/) to experience the in-browser IPFS accessibility firsthand. This test gave me a clear view of how such links could support more decentralized, browser-native applications, which is central to several ongoing projects.

Working with Adin and the IP Shipyard team has been instrumental in advancing my understanding of browser-integrated IPFS and building tools that can scale to meet the decentralized web’s needs. His insights have clarified both the strategic and technical challenges involved, and his support continues to shape my work in this domain.

",Add QUIC transport support to the Python implementation of libp2p,https://github.com/libp2p/py-libp2p/issues/463,"Wish to share that I have defined the scope of work on adding QUIC transport support to py-libp2p, as outlined in project ticket #463(https://github.com/libp2p/py-libp2p/issues/463) at the document : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p8-KuDrntDqEnuZQpohhN9huxt79P8Oipx-jlL9OqPI/edit?tab=t.0. Refined scope of work with the help of Adin from IPFS Shifyard team. This ticket involves implementing QUIC, a transport layer protocol known for its efficiency and reliability, into the Python implementation of libp2p. Adding QUIC support is essential for enhancing the network’s performance, particularly for applications that require low-latency, secure, and resilient connections.

I received this assignment from Dave after demonstrating engagement and making contributions across the libp2p ecosystem. Dave was incredibly helpful, taking the time to walk me through the requirements and technical challenges of the ticket. His guidance has been instrumental in outlining the steps needed to integrate QUIC and align it with the existing py-libp2p architecture.


The ticket #463(https://github.com/libp2p/py-libp2p/issues/463) aims to add QUIC transport support to the Python implementation of libp2p. QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) is a modern transport protocol that combines the speed of UDP with built-in features typically provided at higher layers, like security and reliability. The inclusion of QUIC is essential for libp2p to improve low-latency communication, resilience to network changes, and support for connection multiplexing, which is critical for high-performance decentralized networks.

Wish to share that I have started the groundwork on adding QUIC transport support to py-libp2p, as outlined in project ticket #463(https://github.com/libp2p/py-libp2p/issues/463). This ticket involves implementing QUIC, a transport layer protocol known for its efficiency and reliability, into the Python implementation of libp2p. Adding QUIC support is essential for enhancing the network’s performance, particularly for applications that require low-latency, secure, and resilient connections.

I received this assignment from Dave after demonstrating engagement and making contributions across the libp2p ecosystem. Dave was incredibly helpful, taking the time to walk me through the requirements and technical challenges of the ticket. His guidance has been instrumental in outlining the steps needed to integrate QUIC and align it with the existing py-libp2p architecture.

According to the libp2p QUIC documentation(https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/transports/quic/), QUIC provides benefits such as connection multiplexing, security via TLS 1.3, and reduced latency. In the context of libp2p, adding QUIC transport allows more efficient data transmission, improving the network’s ability to handle dynamic network conditions while ensuring secure connections. QUIC's features align well with libp2p's goals for modularity and decentralized connectivity, as it can adapt to network disruptions more effectively than traditional TCP.

Integrating QUIC in py-libp2p involves adapting the protocol to work with libp2p’s multiaddress format, handling connection upgrades, and ensuring compatibility with other QUIC implementations across different programming languages in libp2p. This integration will bring py-libp2p closer to parity with other libp2p implementations that already support QUIC, thus making it more versatile for cross-language decentralized applications.
","This week, I worked on the project js-libp2p-example-webrtc-private-to-private(https://github.com/seetadev/js-libp2p-example-webrtc-private-to-private). The focus of this project was to explore universal connectivity within private networks using libp2p’s WebRTC functionality. In particular, I worked on testing a demo that leverages a service worker gateway to streamline in-browser connectivity for IPFS content.

In collaboration with the team, I tested this demo to evaluate its functionality, and we reviewed the test results through a live link: test results link(https://bafkreiaofbtkcyv2pws4zzaneiptp2ftjzwwp2e6qqpglhhglm5q3l467i.ipfs.inbrowser.dev/). This testing provided valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of using service workers for improved connectivity and accessibility within decentralized applications.
",10,"I really appreciated the PLDG stewards’ support and the thoughtful structure of the guild’s programming. The sessions are consistently insightful, and the stewards’ responsiveness to participant feedback has made each interaction incredibly valuable. I’ve especially benefited from the way the programming aligns with practical, hands-on opportunities for developers—this makes it easy to apply new knowledge directly to my work. 

One suggestion would be to consider additional collaborative workshops or “deep dive” sessions on specific projects or libraries, where members can work alongside stewards and peers on real-time issues or updates. This could foster even more active engagement and provide a unique opportunity to build skills while directly contributing to shared goals. Overall, the PLDG programming has been a fantastic resource, and I look forward to continued learning and collaboration!"

Personally, my projects built on IPFS are currently used by thousands of users, and I have a ton of features and bugs to work on.

I specifically wanted to contribute to Helia's documentation. It was incredibly challenging to build an IPFS protocol handler for Peersky using Helia and libp2p. The only available resource was the Discord channel, where the core developers pointed me to the code, leaving me to figure it out on my own.

Unfortunately, I couldn't contribute much because I’m currently focused on Peersky's v1 launch, along with two other open-source projects, making it difficult to manage my time."

After studying both quic-go, a full-featured and optimized QUIC protocol implementation used by Lotus, and webtransport-go, an implementation of WebTransport over HTTP/3, I’m excited to explore their potential in improving py-libp2p.
QUIC Advantages for libp2p:
Faster Handshake: QUIC reduces connection establishment times significantly, completing libp2p handshakes in 2 RTTs compared to 4-5 RTTs with TCP.
Improved Performance: Enhanced congestion control and loss recovery mechanisms enable faster transfer speeds, especially over lossy connections.
Censorship Circumvention: Another connection option improves the chances of bypassing network restrictions.
WebTransport Integration:
WebTransport allows browser nodes to connect directly to Lotus nodes without requiring CA-signed certificates, which can significantly simplify peer-to-peer interactions.
Next Steps:
I plan to start porting essential QUIC modules into py-libp2p, ensuring compatibility with its architecture. The goal is to replicate the performance benefits observed in Go implementations and enable browser-based interactions for enhanced usability.
This effort directly supports Issue #463, and I’m optimistic about the impact this will have on improving the performance and accessibility of py-libp2p.

",Update Readme with correct implementation instructions for calibrationnet + IPC,https://github.com/FIL-Builders/onramp-contracts/issues/2,"I’m currently working on extending the documentation for Issue #1(https://github.com/FIL-Builders/onramp-contracts/issues/1), now under review by Longfei, to include detailed instructions for creating an IPC (InterPlanetary Consensus) chain and running the onramp contract on that chain while making deals on Calibnet. 

This involves exploring the process of setting up an IPC chain, deploying the onramp contract on it, and ensuring seamless integration with Calibnet for deal-making. My goal is to provide comprehensive, step-by-step guidance that can serve as a resource for developers looking to implement similar setups. 

Through this effort, I aim to enhance usability and streamline the onboarding experience for users interacting with the onramp contracts and IPC chains. I’m excited to contribute to Issue #2(https://github.com/FIL-Builders/onramp-contracts/issues/2) by applying what I’m learning and improving the documentation further.",Update Readme with correct implementation instructions for calibrationnet,https://github.com/FIL-Builders/onramp-contracts/issues/1,"This week, I focused on enhancing the Onramp Contract deployment documentation and addressing key challenges encountered during the process. Here’s an overview of my progress:
Updates:
Step-by-Step Deployment Guide:

Incorporating any additional details or steps to ensure clarity and usability for developers.

","4. Actively working on identifying applications and use cases for js-libp2p-example-webrtc-private-to-private (https://github.com/seetadev/js-libp2p-example-webrtc-private-to-private). The project demonstrates how to establish private WebRTC connections using libp2p. My focus is on exploring its potential in real-world scenarios, particularly for decentralised and peer-to-peer applications, which was assigned to me in go-libp2p, js-libp2p open maintainers’ call.

Progress : Focused on identifying applications and real-world use cases. Engaged with developers on libp2p Discord, where I received excellent feedback and a practical use case about removing TURN servers for multiplayer games using libp2p's advanced hole punching.  

Key updates:  
- Engagement on Libp2p Discord: I followed up with developers on the libp2p Discord server to gather insights and discuss potential use cases. This engagement led to valuable feedback, including a shared resource (YouTube video(https://youtu.be/PQIcNS5yys4?si=rpSqaVrr5SLChuv7)) and an interesting query about using WebRTC for multiplayer games. A developer shared their experience, mentioning:  
  ""I'm currently using WebRTC for multiplayer games. How does js-libp2p's WebRTC differ from traditional methods? Currently, I am using a TURN server for failed connections, and would like to remove it. Could libp2p's advanced hole punching help here?""  

- Advanced Hole Punching Exploration: This feedback highlights a practical use case for libp2p's advanced hole punching capabilities, which could eliminate the dependency on TURN servers for private WebRTC connections.  

- Use-Case Identification:  
  1. Gaming: Removing TURN servers could make multiplayer gaming setups more efficient and cost-effective.  
  2. Decentralised Applications: Peer-to-peer applications such as file sharing, video conferencing, or IoT use cases can benefit from enhanced privacy and reduced reliance on centralised servers.  
  3. Education: The example also serves as a teaching tool for demonstrating the power of libp2p's WebRTC stack.

This project is helping build a deeper understanding of js-libp2p's WebRTC module and how its unique features can solve real-world challenges. The feedback received so far has been instrumental in shaping the direction of my exploration, and I look forward to identifying more impactful use cases.

------------------

5. https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go) : This week, I focused on testing the QUIC protocol's implementation within Lotus nodes, particularly analyzing how a significant number of connections are handled on QUIC-enabled nodes. To support this, I explored the quic-go module, which offers a robust and full-featured implementation of the QUIC protocol in Go.  

Key Highlights:
1. Testing and Analysis: 
   - Investigating connection patterns on QUIC-enabled Lotus nodes and reviewing relevant metrics using Grafana. This analysis will help identify performance improvements and validate the module's effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

2. QUIC-Go Exploration: 
   - Delving into the quic-go module(https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go), I explored its functionalities and started designing tests to evaluate its features in the context of libp2p and Lotus integrations.

This work aligns with ongoing efforts to improve protocol performance and adaptability, paving the way for further enhancements in decentralized storage and peer-to-peer networking.

",Yes,"Fil-B,Fil-Oz,IPFS,Libp2p","My interactions with LongfeiW have been highly collaborative and productive. Recently, I worked on Issue #1 and Issue #2 from the Onramp Contracts repository(https://github.com/FIL-Builders/onramp-contracts/issues/1 and https://github.com/FIL-Builders/onramp-contracts/issues/2 ) and shared a detailed deployment guide with them, which includes environment setup, contract compilation, deployment commands, and troubleshooting notes (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BKLFEK4Y2EA__PX89jeov_C9oEAVPy7sfaY59dTsqh8/edit?tab=t.0 ). They’ve been instrumental in providing context and direction for the project.

Additionally, I created a hackathon cheat sheet with step-by-step guidance and screenshots to support developers working on similar tasks (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yTbEUseQl_MH21WkhBcDffUlE2QMopWOSqrbsDRn1SA/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.p29kk32yh5bm
). Longfei’s input helped ensure the guide covered key aspects relevant to developers.

Furthermore, I documented deployment issues encountered on Windows systems with Linux subsystems, highlighting errors with commands and compatibility challenges (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oyAVSD9DSlhvN6505x0ttHx-Egsiiahsi60JOStM_XU/edit?tab=t.0 ). The feedback has been invaluable for identifying potential troubleshooting approaches and refining the documentation.

In addition to our collaboration on the Onramp Contracts project, I also shared libp2p curriculum design points for a Board of Studies meeting at NSUT University (please visit https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1JpaC7pJu4sIMCsp_HBJnhq3WclU0WVvJ ). The curriculum is aimed at teaching students about libp2p architecture and modules, with a focus on blockchain-based startups leveraging Filecoin and IPFS. This initiative highlights the potential for integrating decentralised technologies into academic learning to inspire the next generation of blockchain innovators.

Additionally, with Adin’s help, I had the chance to test inbrowser.link—a browser-compatible IPFS link format designed to demonstrate the accessibility of IPFS content within browser environments. Testing with the example link he provided (https://bafkreiaofbtkcyv2pws4ssaneiptp2ftjswwp2e6qqpglhhglm5q3l467i.ipfs.inbrowser.dev/) allowed me to see firsthand the potential of direct IPFS access in a browser setting, which is essential for scaling decentralised web use cases.

This session was particularly informative because it combined a practical demonstration with a deep dive into how IPFS can evolve to meet modern web demands. With direct access to IPFS content, web apps can achieve unprecedented levels of resilience and decentralisation, and this experience has broadened my understanding of the possible integrations and optimisations within the IPFS ecosystem.
",Yes,4+,Design and implement QUIC support for the py-libp2p library,https://github.com/libp2p/py-libp2p/issues/463,"py-libp2p Issue #463 involves designing and implementing QUIC support for the py-libp2p library. QUIC is essential for enhancing the performance and reliability of libp2p networking, and this effort will help bring parity with other libp2p implementations.

As part of this project:  
- I have updated the QUIC design reference to include dotnet-libp2p and Nim-libp2p, following insightful discussions with Adin from IPFS Shipyard and Umar Farooq. Their feedback helped align the design with multi-language libp2p implementations to ensure cross-compatibility.  
- The detailed design and implementation roadmap are documented in my statement of work, which is available at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p8-KuDrntDqEnusQpohhN9huxt79P8Oipx-jlL9OqPI/edit?tab=t.0 .  

This week, I made significant progress on enhancing libp2p functionality, focusing on porting key modules of QUIC from quic-go into the py-libp2p module. After studying both quic-go, a full-featured and optimized QUIC protocol implementation used by Lotus, and webtransport-go, an implementation of WebTransport over HTTP/3, I’m excited to explore their potential in improving py-libp2p.

Key milestones include:  
1. Analysing QUIC protocol specifications in the context of libp2p.  
2. Drafting a modular architecture to integrate QUIC into the `py-libp2p` stack.  
3. Ensuring compatibility with existing implementations in other languages like go-libp2p and js-libp2p.  
4. Building a roadmap for testing and deployment.  

This project is a significant step towards expanding the capabilities of py-libp2p and enabling efficient decentralised applications in Python. Feedback from the libp2p community has been instrumental in shaping the design and implementation strategy.

Next Steps:
I plan to start porting essential QUIC modules into py-libp2p, ensuring compatibility with its architecture. The goal is to replicate the performance benefits observed in Go implementations and enable browser-based interactions for enhanced usability.
This effort directly supports Issue #463, and I’m optimistic about the impact this will have on improving the performance and accessibility of py-libp2p.

",Identifying applications and real-world use cases for WebRTC Private-to-Private Connections  , https://github.com/seetadev/js-libp2p-example-webrtc-private-to-private,"Actively working on identifying applications and use cases for js-libp2p-example-webrtc-private-to-private (https://github.com/seetadev/js-libp2p-example-webrtc-private-to-private). The project demonstrates how to establish private WebRTC connections using libp2p. My focus is on exploring its potential in real-world scenarios, particularly for decentralised and peer-to-peer applications, which was assigned to me in go-libp2p, js-libp2p open maintainers’ call.

Key progress and updates:  
- Engagement on Libp2p Discord: I followed up with developers on the libp2p Discord server to gather insights and discuss potential use cases. This engagement led to valuable feedback, including a shared resource (YouTube video(https://youtu.be/PQIcNS5yys4?si=rpSqaVrr5SLChuv7)) and an interesting query about using WebRTC for multiplayer games. A developer shared their experience, mentioning:  
  ""I'm currently using WebRTC for multiplayer games. How does js-libp2p's WebRTC differ from traditional methods? Currently, I am using a TURN server for failed connections, and would like to remove it. Could libp2p's advanced hole punching help here?""  

- Advanced Hole Punching Exploration: This feedback highlights a practical use case for libp2p's advanced hole punching capabilities, which could eliminate the dependency on TURN servers for private WebRTC connections.  

- Use-Case Identification:  
  1. Gaming: Removing TURN servers could make multiplayer gaming setups more efficient and cost-effective.  
  2. Decentralised Applications: Peer-to-peer applications such as file sharing, video conferencing, or IoT use cases can benefit from enhanced privacy and reduced reliance on centralised servers.  
  3. Education: The example also serves as a teaching tool for demonstrating the power of libp2p's WebRTC stack.

This project is helping build a deeper understanding of js-libp2p's WebRTC module and how its unique features can solve real-world challenges. The feedback received so far has been instrumental in shaping the direction of my exploration, and I look forward to identifying more impactful use cases.

Update from Maintainer and OSS meetings: In my recent meetings with Umar Farooq from the libp2p team and Sujata Tibrevala from ByteDance’s OSS team, we explored several potential use cases for the private-to-private WebRTC project. We discussed how the project’s capabilities could enhance secure, decentralised peer-to-peer communication across various applications. 

During libp2p specifical meeting with Umar Farooq, we focused on the large message transmission challenges within GossipSub, which cause longer-than-expected dissemination times and fluctuations. Umar’s work has been instrumental in analysing the underlying reasons for this behaviour and proposing straightforward improvements. These enhancements maintain Gossip Subs’ resilience while significantly improving message handling efficiency.

For the private-to-private WebRTC use case, we plan to prioritise integrating these insights from Umar’s work to optimise performance during large message transmissions. This approach will help ensure smoother and more predictable data transfer, a key requirement for secure, real-time peer-to-peer communication applications.

Sujata offered valuable insights into industry-specific needs, particularly around real-time collaboration tools and secure media sharing, while Umar provided technical context on potential optimisations within libp2p to support these use cases. This collaborative approach has been instrumental in identifying practical, high-impact scenarios where private-to-private WebRTC can deliver value. ","4. IPFS Shipyard issue at go-libp2p maintainer’s call: https://github.com/ipfs/service-worker-gateway
Revisit the test Result following the documentation steps: https://bafkreiaofbtkcyv2pws4ssaneiptp2ftjswwp2e6qqpglhhglm5q3l467i.ipfs.inbrowser.dev/

I tested the IPFS service-worker gateway(https://github.com/ipfs/service-worker-gateway), an innovative approach to enabling direct browser access to IPFS content. This gateway utilises service workers to bypass traditional IPFS gateways, aiming to streamline and decentralise data retrieval directly within browser environments.

With the guidance of Adin Schmahmann, I conducted a series of tests to evaluate the service worker’s functionality. The test results were captured through a live demonstration link: inbrowser IPFS link( https://bafkreiaofbtkcyv2pws4ssaneiptp2ftjswwp2e6qqpglhhglm5q3l467i.ipfs.inbrowser.dev/). This link showcases the gateway’s ability to render IPFS-hosted content directly within the browser, illustrating the potential of a fully decentralised web experience.

This project provided valuable insights into the practical applications of service workers for IPFS, highlighting areas where user accessibility and performance can be improved.

Name: Use IPFS as a Buffer in OnRamp Contracts  

Description: The current OnRamp setup relies on a temporary server to buffer and store client data before initiating a storage deal with an SP. This approach is not scalable and places an operational burden on the infrastructure operator. By integrating IPFS as the buffer, we can eliminate the need for centralized temporary storage, reduce infrastructure overhead, and improve the decentralization of the process.
Key Work Completed
Initial Analysis:

Reviewed the current data buffering flow within the OnRamp Contracts.
Identified where the temporary server could be replaced with IPFS to store CAR files before making deals.
IPFS Integration Plan:

Proposed a workflow where CAR files are uploaded to IPFS, and the resulting CID (Content Identifier) is referenced in the OnRamp contract.
This ensures that the data remains verifiable and decentralized until the storage deal is finalized with the SP.
Advantages of Using IPFS:

Reduced Infrastructure Burden: No need to maintain temporary servers.
Decentralization: Data storage remains decentralized, aligning with the broader goals of the Filecoin network.
Verifiability: CIDs provide cryptographic proof of the stored data.
Relevant Resources:
IPFS Documentation: IPFS Docs for guidance on adding and retrieving data.
CAR File Generation: Ensured that the CAR file creation process is compatible with IPFS for seamless uploads.
OnRamp Contract Codebase: Analyzed existing logic to identify where IPFS upload functionality can be integrated.
Next Steps:
Develop a proof-of-concept for integrating IPFS as a buffer.
Test the new workflow to ensure it meets performance and reliability requirements.
Update documentation to reflect changes in the buffering process.
By leveraging IPFS as a buffer, we can make the OnRamp Contracts more scalable, efficient, and aligned with the principles of decentralized storage.

Issue 6: Name: Adding IPC subnet support 

Link: https://github.com/FIL-Builders/onramp-contracts/issues/3

Description: In the OnRamp Contracts project within the Filecoin Builders ecosystem, we're enhancing the contract functionality to support InterPlanetary Consensus (IPC) subnets. This initiative aims to enable seamless deployment and execution of on-ramp contracts on IPC subnets, facilitating robust cross-subnet messaging (GMP) and efficient token transfers between Ethereum, Filecoin, and IPC networks.

-Planned Tasks and Progress

Deploy an IPC Subnet:

To begin, I'm setting up an IPC subnet under the Calibnet network for testing purposes.
Using the documentation provided in the IPC quickstart guide:
 Deploy a Subnet Quickstart (https://docs.ipc.space/quickstarts/deploy-a-subnet )
To streamline this process, I am testing the automation script:
 deploy.sh Script (https://github.com/consensus-shipyard/ipc/blob/main/scripts/deploy_subnet_under_calibration_net/deploy.sh )
This script automates the steps for deploying a subnet under the Calibnet network, reducing the manual effort required.

Deploy OnRamp Contracts on the IPC Subnet:

After successfully setting up the IPC subnet, the next step is to deploy the on-ramp contracts on this subnet.
This will involve adapting the deployment configurations to ensure compatibility with IPC-specific parameters and verifying the contract interactions within the subnet environment.


Adapt IPC GMP (General Message Passing) for Cross-Subnet Messaging:

To facilitate communication between different IPC subnets and the parent chain, the on-ramp contracts need to support IPC GMP.
This adaptation will enable assets and messages to be transferred seamlessly across subnets, maintaining consistency and reliability.
Reference for GMP implementation:
 LinkedToken.sol Example (https://github.com/consensus-shipyard/ipc/blob/main/extras/linked-token/contracts/LinkedToken.sol#L179 )
This contract provides insights into handling token transfers and GMP within IPC environments, which can be adapted for the on-ramp contracts.

Token Payment Considerations:

Determine which token will be used for payments within the IPC subnets. This may involve using the native subnet token or a wrapped token compatible with cross-subnet GMP.
Ensure the on-ramp contracts handle token payments securely and efficiently, aligning with the IPC token transfer standards.
Goals and Outcomes
Seamless Deployment:
 Enable developers to easily deploy and interact with on-ramp contracts on IPC subnets.


Cross-Subnet Compatibility:
 Ensure that the on-ramp contracts support cross-subnet messaging via IPC GMP, facilitating asset transfers and communication across different subnets and the parent chain.


Automation and Documentation:

Automate subnet deployment using the provided script to streamline setup processes.
Improve documentation to guide developers through deploying IPC nodes, setting up subnets, and deploying on-ramp contracts on IPC.


Next Steps
Deploy the IPC subnet using the automation script and validate the setup.
Deploy on-ramp contracts on the subnet and test their functionality.
Adapt GMP in the on-ramp contracts to support cross-subnet messaging.
Document the entire process, including detailed instructions for:
Deploying an IPC subnet.
Deploying on-ramp contracts on IPC subnets.
Configuring GMP for cross-subnet interactions.
Handling token payments within IPC subnets.
